## Breast Cancer Prediction System

This project aims to develop a comprehensive breast cancer prediction system
comprising two integral modules: a prediction module and a correlation analysis
module. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and correlation analysis
techniques, this project seeks to provide accurate predictions and in-depth insights into
breast cancer risk factors.

This uses Logistic Regression model.
